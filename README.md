Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock is a popular expansion to the game rock-paper-scissors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors), invented by Sam Kass. It adds "Spock" and "lizard" to the standard three options. "Spock" is represented with the Star Trek Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. It appeared in an episode of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, "The Lizard-Spock Expansion", in 2008.
